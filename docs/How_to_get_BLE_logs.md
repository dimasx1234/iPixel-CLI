# Tutorial : Getting BLE logs from an Android device

Requirements:

- An Android device with Bluetooth capabilities
- [adb](https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools) (Android Debug Bridge) installed on your computer
- USB cable to connect the Android device to your computer (or Wifi for wireless setup)
- [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) if you want to analyze the logs

## Steps

Before you start capturing BLE logs, you need to prepare your Android device:

1. Enable USB debugging on your Android device:
   - Go to **Settings** > **About phone**.
   - Tap on **Build number** 7 times to enable Developer options.
   - Go back to **Settings** > **Developer options** and enable **USB debugging**.
   *Steps may vary slightly depending on your Android version and device manufacturer.*
2. **Enable Bluetooth HCI snoop log** on your Android device:
   - Go to **Settings** > **Developer options**.
   - Scroll down and set **Bluetooth HCI snoop log** to **Enabled**.
   - Restart the bluetooth service by toggling Bluetooth off and then on again.

You can now do actions on your Android device that will generate BLE logs. When you are done, follow these steps to retrieve the logs:

1. **Connect your Android device** to your computer using a USB cable or ensure you have a wireless ADB setup.
2. **Open a terminal** or command prompt on your computer.
3. **Check if your device is connected** by running:

   ```bash
   adb devices
   ```

   You should see your device listed.

   *If you see "unauthorized", make sure to accept the USB debugging prompt on your Android device.*
4. **Generate a bugreport** from your device by running:

   ```bash
   adb bugreport 
   ```

   This command will create a zip file containing various logs, including the Bluetooth HCI snoop log.
   The zip file will be saved in the current directory with a name like `bugreport-<device_name>-<timestamp>.zip`.
5. **Extract the log** from the bug report by unzipping `FS/data/misc/bluetooth/logs/btsnoop_hci_<date>_<time>.log`.
    If you only have a file named `btsnooz_hci.log`, data sent to BLE devices has been filtered from logging, make sure you set Bluetooth HCI snoop log to **Enabled** and restart your device.

6. **Analyze the log file**:
   - You can open the `btsnoop_hci.log` file in Wireshark for analysis.
   - In Wireshark, go to **File** > **Open** and select the `btsnoop_hci.log` file.
   - Protip: use filter `(btatt.opcode.method == 0x12)` to only view write requests sent to BLE devices.
